I'm going to try to get 10 leetcode problems done in JS tonight so I can keep working on syntax!

## First one: Jaden_Case, convert the first letter of each word to uppercase.

I just learned that strings are immutable you cannot change them like you can in python
I refreshed on the format of for loops
I learned how to slice strings
And I learned about prototype functions and that it is not a thing in python.
(This stackoverflow post was very informative https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4650513/why-is-javascript-prototyping)

## Second one: Find the divisors, return every number that the number is evenly divisable by if none return prime

I learned to append to lists in JS you use the .push method
